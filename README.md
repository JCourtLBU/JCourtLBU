# Hi there!

## 🤷🏻 Who Am I?
### I'm Jack, Welcome to my Github Profile


Im a Level 4 Student at Leeds Beckett University studying Cyber Security and Digital Forensics. 

I have studied Computer Science and Programming at both GCSE and A-Level stages, from 2020-2025. 

I am a huge fan of football (NFFC🔴⚪) and Formula One (McLaren🟠)

My profile picture is (unfortunately) not me! It is Daniel Ricciardo, my favourite formula one driver, who retired in 2024. It shows him doing a "Shoey", his trademark celebration for a podium/win. 

## 💻 Programming Skills
- **Python:** I am very familiar with python, having used it throughout my studies for the past 5/6 years.
- **Lua:** I have advanced experience in Lua through Roblox Studio, as I used to script many games and systems in Roblox for both my own projects and for commission.
